## AI - Concepts

```xml 
Models: 
------
AI models are algorithms designed to process and 
generate information, often mimicking human cognitive functions. 
By learning patterns and insights from large datasets, 
these models can make predictions, text, images, 
or other outputs, enhancing various applications across industries.
Eg. GPT-4o


Prompts: 
-------
Prompts serve as the foundation for the language-based inputs that 
guide an AI model to produce specific outputs. 
For those familiar with ChatGPT, a prompt might seem like merely 
the text entered into a dialog box that is sent to the API. 
However, it encompasses much more than that. 
In many AI Models, the text for the prompt is not just a simple string.


Prompt Templates: 
----------------
Creating effective prompts involves establishing the context of the 
request and substituting parts of the request with values 
specific to the userâ€™s input.
For instance, consider the simple prompt template:
Tell me a {adjective} joke about {content}.


Tokens: 
------
Tokens serve as the building blocks of how an AI model works. 
On input, models convert words to tokens. 
On output, they convert tokens back to words.


Building blocks for LLM:
-----------------------
Retrieval (Query Result)
Tool (Call response)
Memory (Read / Write)


LLM Workflows: 
--------------

Prompt Chaining:
It decomposes tasks into sequence of steps where each call 
processes the output of the previous one. We can add programatic 
check (gate) on any intermediate steps to ensure that the process 
is still on track. 

Routing: 
Routing classifies the input and directs it to a specialized 
followup task. This workflow allows for speration of concerns 
and building more specialized prompts. Without this workflow 
optimizing on one kind of input can hurt performance of other
inputs. 

Parallelization:
LLM can sometime work simulataneously on task and have their 
output aggregated programmatically.
Two parts of parallelization are: 
Sectioning: Break task into independent subtask and run it in parallel
Voting: Running the same task multiple times to get diverse output

Orchestator Worker: 
A central LLM dynamically breaks down tasks, delegates them to 
worker LLMs and synthesizes their results 

Evaluator Optimizer:
One LLM call generates a respone, while another provides evaluation
and feeback in a loop.

## Setup - OpenAI 
```xml 
OpenAI
------
1. Create an account on OpenAI.
2. Generate the token on the API Keys page
https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

Copy the token to be added later in the spring application properties or yaml file 

Note: Free account wiil not work and so I topped up my account for $5 
before generating my API key. 
If you generated an API key before, please generate another one after 
topping up your account and use that in your application.

## OpenAI Image generation (ai-image-generator)
```xml

@Service -> ImageModel is the main interface used for generating images 
and it is called in the service layer

@RestController() -> This opens up an URL http://localhost:8080/image/generate
to which you can submit your image generation prompt 

Run the service and call the url like this example below: 
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/image/generate?prompt=Monkey%20playing%20cricket"

and you will receive a response which can be run on a browser to check the generated image 

Full details of this example can be found here:
https://dzone.com/articles/spring-ai-generate-images-openai-dalle?edition=958905

More details about spring ai can be found here:
https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/

```

## OpenAI Chatbot (ai-chat-assistant)
```xml

@RestController() -> This opens up an URL http://localhost:8080/chat/query
to which you can submit your chating prompt 

Run the service and call the url like this example below: 
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/chat/query?userInput=What%20is%20the%20best%20language%20model%20for%20AI%3F%20'

and you will receive a response which can be displayed on the screen 

Full details of this example can be found here:
https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/chatclient.html

***Note: This sample is just a tip of an iceberg of what chat assistant could do******

```

## OpenAI Chatbot - Formatting the output (ai-chat-assistant-formatted-output)
```xml

@RestController() -> This opens up an URL http://localhost:8080/chat/query
to which you can submit your chating prompt 


There is also an overloaded entity method with the signature 
entity(ParameterizedTypeReference<T> type) that lets you specify types 
such as generic Lists:
@GetMapping("/chat/query")
List<Article> askQuestion(@RequestParam(name = "question") String question) {
    return chatClient.prompt()
      .user(question)
      .call()
      .entity(new ParameterizedTypeReference<List<Article>>() {});
}

Article model consist of the following structure: 
 public class Article {
  
  private String name;
  private String category;
  private String fullDescription;

}

Note: This is how my output will be formatted

Run the service and call the url like this example below: 
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/chat/query?question=Who%20are%20the%20top%2010%20actors%20in%20the%20world%3F'
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/chat/query?question=What%20is%20the%20top%205%20language%20model%20for%20AI%3F'

and you will receive a formatted response which can be displayed on the screen

5. The fundametal component of OpenAI chat is ChatModel class.
Create a @Service class called AskAIChatService and autowire ChatModel

@Autowired
ChatModel chatModel;

6. Input the prompt to this model and return the response
public String getResponse(String prompt) {
    return chatModel.call(prompt);
}

7. Create a Rest controller called AskAIController 
and autowire this service
@Autowired
AskAIChatService askAIChatService;

8. Add a GetMapping to this controller and pass the request parameter 
named prompt to the askAIChatService and return the response 
@GetMapping("ask-ai")
public String getRespone(@RequestParam String prompt) {
  return askAIChatService.getResponse(prompt);
}

9. Start the application and execute the service from a browser 
or postman or from command line using curl 
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/ask-ai?prompt=What%20is%20the%20top%20rated%20AI%20tool%20to%20learn%3F%20and%20format%20the%20output'

```

## OpenAI Chatbot - Customizing the ChatModel (ai-prompt-assistant)
```xml
10. Create 2 static final variables in the Service class
This variables and many others could be customized. 
Full list could be found in the below link. 
https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create
private static final String MODEL="gpt-4o"; // https://platform.openai.com/docs/models
private static final Double TEMPRATURE=0.4D; 


11. Create a new method called getResponseOptions and 
customize the chatModel with the final varibale values created. 

public String getResponseOptions(String prompt) {
  ChatResponse response = chatModel.call(
        new Prompt(
            prompt,
            OpenAiChatOptions.builder()
                .model(MODEL)
                .temperature(TEMPRATURE)
            .build()
        ));
  return response.getResult().getOutput().getContent();
}

12. Add a GetMapping to the controller and pass the request parameter 
named prompt to the askAIChatService's getResponseOptions method 
and return the response: 

@GetMapping("ask-ai-options")
public String getResponeOptions(@RequestParam String prompt) {
  return askAIChatService.getResponseOptions(prompt);
}

13. Start the application and execute the service from a browser 
or postman or from command line using curl 
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/ask-ai-options?prompt=What%20is%20the%20best%20programming%20language%20to%20learn%20today%3F'


```


## OpenAI Chatbot - Formatting the output of the ChatModel (ai-prompt-assistant)
```xml
14. Create a record in the Service class that will carry the formatted output
public record MathReasoning(
      @JsonProperty(required = true, value = "steps") Steps steps,
      @JsonProperty(required = true, value = "final_answer") String finalAnswer) {

  record Steps(
      @JsonProperty(required = true, value = "items") Items[] items) {

    record Items(
        @JsonProperty(required = true, value = "explanation") String explanation,
        @JsonProperty(required = true, value = "output") String output) {}
  }
}

15. Add method for getting the formatted output:
public MathReasoning getResponeFormatted() {
  var outputConverter = new BeanOutputConverter<>(MathReasoning.class);

  var jsonSchema = outputConverter.getJsonSchema();

  Prompt prompt = new Prompt("how can I solve 8x + 7 = -23",
    OpenAiChatOptions.builder()
        .model(MODEL)
        .temperature(TEMPRATURE)
        .responseFormat(new ResponseFormat(ResponseFormat.Type.JSON_SCHEMA, jsonSchema))
        .build());

  ChatResponse response = chatModel.call(prompt);
  String content = response.getResult().getOutput().getContent();

  MathReasoning mathReasoning = outputConverter.convert(content);
  return mathReasoning;
}

The responseFormat is set in the new Prompt method chaining and result is 
converted in the outputConverter
Check the following links for more information: 
https://spring.io/blog/2024/08/09/spring-ai-embraces-openais-structured-outputs-enhancing-json-response

16. Add a GetMapping to the controller and pass the request parameter 
named prompt to the askAIChatService's getResponeMath method 
and return the response: 

@GetMapping(value="ask-ai-math",produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
public MathReasoning getResponeMath() {
  return askAIChatService.getResponeFormatted();
}

17. Start the application and execute the service from a browser 
or postman or from command line using curl 
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/ask-ai-math'


```

## OpenAI Generating Image From Prompt - Step by Step (ai-prompt-assistant)
```xml
18. To generate an image from prompt lets create a new service 
called AskAIImageService 

@Service
public class AskAIImageService {

}

19. We will inject the OpenAI Image Model into this service 
by autowiring

@Autowired
OpenAiImageModel openAiImageModel;

20. Next we will create an image response 
by setting a few image options like height, width etc. 
public ImageResponse generateImage(String prompt) {
  ImageResponse response = openAiImageModel.call(
          new ImagePrompt(prompt,
          OpenAiImageOptions.builder()
                  .quality("hd")
                  .N(1) // default is dall-e-3 model which support max 1 image generation per request
                  .height(1024)
                  .width(1024).build())

  );
  return response;
}

21. Finally add a controller method in our AskAIController class 
which will build an url from the image response object 
and redirect us to this url. 

@GetMapping("ask-ai-image-generate")
public void generateImage(HttpServletResponse httpServletResponse, @RequestParam String prompt) throws IOException {
  ImageResponse imageResponse= askAIImageService.generateImage(prompt);
  String imageURL = imageResponse.getResult().getOutput().getUrl();

  // Use this in case you need multiple images from the response 
  // Supported in dall-e-2
  /*
  List<String> imageURLs=imageResponse.getResults().stream()
      .map(result-> result.getOutput().getUrl())
      .toList();
  
  */

  httpServletResponse.sendRedirect(imageURL);
}

22. Run this on the browser and add any prompt you need 
and see the result.
http://localhost:8080/ask-ai-image-generate?prompt=Harry%20Potter%20in%20India

```


## OpenAI - Generating Results from Template - Step by Step (ai-prompt-assistant)
```xml
23. Lets create a template for recipie with ingredients, cuisine and dietary restriction choices
Create a service (AskAIRecipeService) and autowire the ChatModel 

24. Create a template 
var template ="""
    I want to create a recipie using the following ingredients: {ingredients}.
    The cuisine type I prefer is: {cuisine}.
    Please consider the following dietaryRestrictions: {dietaryRestrictions}.
    Please provide me a detail recipe including title, list of ingredients, and cooking instructions
  """;

25. Create a PromptTempalate object and inject the template and params into it. 
PromptTemplate promptTemplate=new PromptTemplate(template);
Map<String, Object> params=Map.of(
    "ingredients", ingredients,
    "cuisine", cuisine,
    "dietaryRestrictions", dietaryRestrictions
    );

26. Finally create a prompt and chat model out of it. 
Prompt prompt=promptTemplate.create(params);
return chatModel.call(prompt).getResult().getOutput().getContent();
 

19. We will inject the OpenAI Chat Model into the controller service 
by autowiring
@Autowired
AskAIRecipeService askAIIRecipeService;

27. Add a GetMapping to the controller and pass the request parameter 
named ingredients, cuisine and dietaryRestrictions  to the askAIIRecipeService's 
getResponeRecipe method and return the response: 

@GetMapping("ask-ai-recipe-creator")
public String getResponeRecipe(@RequestParam String ingredients, 
    @RequestParam(defaultValue = "any") String cuisine, 
    @RequestParam(defaultValue = "") String dietaryRestrictions) {
  return askAIIRecipeService.createRecipe(ingredients, cuisine, dietaryRestrictions);
}

28. Start the application and execute the service from 
postman or from command line using curl 
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/ask-ai-recipe-creator?ingredients=chicken%2C%20curry%20masala%2C%20olives%2C%20onion%2C%20tomatoes&cuisine=Indian'

```

## OpenAI - Audio Transcription model - Step by Step (ai-audio-transcribe)
```xml
1. Add the Spring AI dependency. 

2. In the application.properties file add the following: 
spring.ai.openai.api-key=<your api key>
spring.ai.openai.audio.transcription.base-url=https://api.openai.com
spring.ai.openai.audio.transcription.options.model=whisper-1
spring.ai.openai.audio.transcription.options.response-format=json

3. Create a controller 'TranscriptionController' and inject the following:
private final OpenAiAudioTranscriptionModel transcriptionModel;

public TranscriptionController(@Value("${spring.ai.openai.api-key}") String apiKey) {
    OpenAiAudioApi openAiAudioApi = new OpenAiAudioApi(apiKey);
    this.transcriptionModel
            = new OpenAiAudioTranscriptionModel(openAiAudioApi);
}

4. Create a ResponseEntity as follows:

@CrossOrigin(origins = "http://localhost:5173", maxAge = 3600)
@PostMapping("ai-audio-transcriptor")
public ResponseEntity<String> transcribeAudio(
        @RequestParam("file") MultipartFile file) throws IOException {
    File tempFile = File.createTempFile("audio",".wav");
    file.transferTo(tempFile);

    
    OpenAiAudioTranscriptionOptions transcriptionOptions = OpenAiAudioTranscriptionOptions.builder()
            .responseFormat(OpenAiAudioApi.TranscriptResponseFormat.TEXT)
            .language("en")
            .temperature(0f)
            .build();

    FileSystemResource audioFile = new FileSystemResource(tempFile);

    AudioTranscriptionPrompt transcriptionRequest = new AudioTranscriptionPrompt(audioFile, transcriptionOptions);
    AudioTranscriptionResponse response = transcriptionModel.call(transcriptionRequest);

    tempFile.delete();
    return new ResponseEntity<>(response.getResult().getOutput(), HttpStatus.OK);
}

5. Run the application. 

6. Run the following from command line or postman:
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/ai-audio-transcriptor?file=null' \
--form 'file=@"/<your-file-location>/hello.mp3"'

Note: I created the hello.mp3 from the following website: https://ttsmp3.com/

```

## OpenAI RAG - Retrieval Augmented Generation (ai-rag-textreader)
```xml
# Vector Database: 
A vector database is a collection of data stored as mathematical representations. 
Vector databases make it easier for machine learning models to remember previous inputs, 
allowing machine learning to be used to power search, recommendations, 
and text generation use-cases. Data can be identified based on similarity metrics instead 
of exact matches, making it possible for a computer model to understand data contextually.

1. Add the Spring OpenAI dependency. 

2. In the application.properties file add the following: 
spring.ai.openai.api-key=<your api key>

3. To generate an RAG response from prompt lets create a new service 
called RagConfiguration 

@Configuration
public class RagConfiguration {

}

4. Creat a method called simpleVectorStore which will 
read a text file from a path containing the faq and convert 
it back to a vector file. If the file already exist, then it 
will not create the vector file again. 


5. Create a controller 'RagController' which will read the 
message from the user and also read the Vector file, stuff everything 
into a template, and create a Prompt before sending it to OpenAI 
to get the output against the Vector content provided 


6. Run the application. 

7. Run the following from command line or postman:
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/faq?message=how%20many%20sports%20%20does%20Olympics%20have'


```


## Running a Machine Learning model locally - Ollama (ai-rag-ollama-pdfreader)
```xml 

1. Download ollama and install it according to your OS version
https://ollama.com/download

Once installed run the following commands to check: 
ollama --version
ollama ls => This command will list all the models that are currently installed locally 

Supported models and the command to install them are given in the below link:
https://github.com/ollama/ollama
Example command to download and install one of the models is:
ollama run llama3.3

2. Run Olloma from the PC after installation (installed under applications in MAC)
Check at http://localhost:11434/ if it is running fine

3. Create a spring project with following dependencies: 
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-ai-ollama-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
</dependency>

4. Add one more dependency 
PDF Document reader and implementation of Apache PDFBoxÂ® - A Java PDF Library
The Apache PDFBoxÂ® library is an open source Java tool for working 
with PDF documents. This project allows creation of new PDF documents, 
manipulation of existing documents and the ability to 
extract content from documents.

<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-ai-pdf-document-reader</artifactId>
</dependency>

5. Add the following in application.properties file:

spring.ai.ollama.chat.options.model=llama3.2:latest
spring.ai.ollama.embedding.enabled=true
spring.ai.ollama.embedding.options.model=llama3.2:latest

file.path=classpath:data/sample.pdf

The file path is where the sample pdf file resides which will be read and 
convered into an in memory vector database 


6. Create 2 model files for request and response: 
ChatResponse.java
QueryRequest.java

7. Create a configuration file called VectorBuilder.java 
This file will read the PDF file in the <classpath>/data folder and 
will convert the content to be stored in a VectorStore (database)

8. Finally create a PDFController file which will inject the 
VectorStore and ChatClient
Use the VectorStore to find a similarity search and convert 
the respone into the ChatResponse object before returning it 

9. Run the application. 

10. Run the following from command line or postman:
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/chat' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "query": "Who has the highest salary?"
}'

```

4. Their is a docker compose.yaml file.
Modifiy it as below to add pgadmin, adding db user and password

services:
  pgvector:
    image: 'pgvector/pgvector:pg16'
    environment:
      - 'POSTGRES_DB=chat-engine-db'
      - 'POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret'
      - 'POSTGRES_USER=chat-engine-user'
    labels:
      - "org.springframework.boot.service-connection=postgres"
    ports:
      - '5432:5432'
  pgadmin:
    image: dpage/pgadmin4
    environment:
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL: admin@example.com
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: adminpassword
    ports:
      - "8081:80"
    depends_on:
      - pgvector 

5. Go to command promt and run 
docker compose up 

All the depenedencies for pgvector and pgadmin gets pulled 
and the container starts running

6. Verify the postgres admin panel  
http://localhost:8081/browser/
Enter User ID: admin@example.com
Enter Password: adminpassword

7. Add a new server in the admin browser 
Add new server -> General tab 
Name: localhost

Connection tab 
Host name / address: pgvector
User Name: chat-engine-user
Password: secret

Save and check if the server is added & connected 

8. Using Spring ETL pipeline for Extracting, Transforming and Loading PDF document
https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/1.0/api/etl-pipeline.html

The VectorBuilder.java inside the config folder reads data from the resources/static 
folder, in our case NVIDIAAn.pdf file. Note: mulitple PDF files can be placed in this 
folder and it will all be extracted pagewise, content split and stored in the 
pgvector database.

9. Add configuration in applications.properties file
# needed for open ai access
spring.ai.openai.api-key=${OPEN_AI_KEY}
# needed for creating the schema automatically in pgvector store 
spring.ai.vectorstore.pgvector.initialize-schema=true
# the storage location of the pdf content file that needs to be read 
documents.directory.path=classpath:static

10. Add a controller file that accepts a message, 
finds the similarity search using the vector database, 
and sends fetched document and the message to the ChatGPT engine 
to return the response. 

Note: the below code uses an in-memory chat advisor to store the state of the previous queries

Check the below part in the constructor: 
chatClientBuilder
  .defaultAdvisors(new MessageChatMemoryAdvisor(new InMemoryChatMemory()))
  .build();

And the ChatMessage method for details 
in the ChatController.java file. 

11. Run the application 
Run the application and excute a curl command to see the respone:
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/chat' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "chatId": "2216b193-d85f-4f86-b8cb-26a22bf05652",
    "message": "Give me its revenue growth?"
}'

If no chatId parameter is sent, the program generates a random UUID 

```

## Vector Database - Similarity Search (ai-vector-db)
```xml 
1. Spring Initilizer
Go to spring initilizer page https://start.spring.io/ 
and add the following dependencies: 
Spring Web
Spring JDBC
OpenAI
PGVector
DevTools and
Docker Compose


2. Create a project 'ai-vector-db' and download

3. The pom.xml will have the following dependencies: 
<dependency>

4. Their is a docker compose.yaml file.
Modifiy it to set db user, password and exposed port, in our case 5432
services:
  pgvector:
    image: 'pgvector/pgvector:pg16'
    environment:
      - 'POSTGRES_DB=mydatabase'
      - 'POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret'
      - 'POSTGRES_USER=myuser'
    labels:
      - "org.springframework.boot.service-connection=postgres"
    ports:
      - '5432:5432'

5. Go to command promt and run 
docker compose up 

All the depenedencies for pgvector gets pulled 
and the container starts running

6. Import the sql dump data that is needed for this project
into the our database  
docker exec -i <our running container name> psql -U myuser -d mydatabase < <path to our sql file>/titanic.sql

7. Login to our database and check if passenger table is created and check the record count.
Check and verify if 1309 records are imported. 

7. Read the data from 
https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/1.0/api/etl-pipeline.html

The VectorBuilder.java inside the config folder reads data from the our imported table 
(only once if created) and imports the data into the vector_store table. 

9. Add configuration in applications.properties file
# To start the docker container for pgvector only once
spring.docker.compose.lifecycle-management=start_only
# needed for open ai access
spring.ai.openai.api-key=${OPEN_AI_KEY}
# needed for creating the schema automatically in pgvector store 
spring.ai.vectorstore.pgvector.initialize-schema=true


10. Modify the prompt and run the application
In the VectorBuilder.java we have a variable called 
PROMPT_STRING which can be modified to fetch query results. 

Note: to query we can get the passenger name, 
if the passenger died or alive, 
the passenger final destination city, country 
and if the passenger is male or female. 

I have inserted only these 4 parameters from our original passenger table
into the vector database but please note that the possibilies are limitless

```


## Text to SQL - Static DDL  (ai-text2sql)
```xml

1. Spring Initilizer
Go to spring initilizer page https://start.spring.io/ 
and add the following dependencies: 
Spring Web
OpenAI
DevTools
Note: No database required here, as we give a static DDL statement to AI 
which generates a query based on this. 

2. Create a project 'ai-text2sql' and download

3. The pom.xml will have the following dependencies: 
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-ai-starter-model-openai</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-devtools</artifactId>
  <scope>runtime</scope>
  <optional>true</optional>
</dependency>


4. Add configuration in applications.properties file
# needed for open ai access
spring.ai.openai.api-key=${OPEN_AI_KEY}
# set logging level for spring ai to debug  
logging.level.org.springframework.ai=debug

5. Create Ruquest and Response objects
Create 2 record objects 
TextToSQLRequest and 
TextToSQLResponse
to warp up the request and response object 

6. Add a controller file that accepts a message, 
wraps a the incoming query with the user prompt template,
which also contains the DDL based on which AI must return SQL response  
and sends it to the ChatGPT engine to return the response. 

Check the below part in the TextToSqlController.java controller file: 
private static final String USER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
      You are a Postgres expert. Please generate SQL statements to answer user's query. 
      
      The table name is netflix_shows. Column names and data types are shown as below: 
      show_id, text; type, text; title, text; director, text; cast_members, text; country, text; 
      date_added, date; release_year, int4; rating, text; duration, text; 
      listed_in, text; description, text.
      
      Output the SQL only. Don't use Markdown format and output the query in a single line.
      
      {user_input}
      """;
This is where we send DDL and the user_input to ChatGPT model that then generates the SQL.  

Check the textToSql method for details in the TextToSqlController.java file. 

11. Run the application 
Run the application and excute a curl command to see the respone:
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/texttosql' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "input": "How many shows were produced in 2020?"
}'

This will result in a response containing the SQL query like below:
{
    "sql": "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM netflix_shows WHERE release_year = 2020;"
}

Verify it with the netflix.sql file to check the correctness 
(this could be inserted into a live database and checked for results)

The command to do this would be:
docker pull postgres
docker run --name ai-text2sql -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret -e POSTGRES_USER=myuser -e POSTGRES_DB=mydatabase -p 5432:5432 -d postgres   
docker exec -i <our running container name> psql -U myuser -d mydatabase < <path to our sql file>/netflix.sql

```

## Text To SQL - Dynamic DDL (ai-text2sql-dynamic)
### (we have it stored in a file schema.sql which is fed to AI engine)
```xml 
1. Spring Initilizer
Go to spring initilizer page https://start.spring.io/ 
and add the following dependencies: 
Spring Web
Spring JDBC
OpenAI
DevTools and
Postgres

2. Create a project 'ai-text2sql-dynamic' and download

3. The pom.xml will have the following dependencies: 
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-jdbc</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>

<dependency>
  <groupId>org.postgresql</groupId>
  <artifactId>postgresql</artifactId>
  <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>


4. Install postgres using docker image and start the container. 
docker pull postgres
docker run --name ai-text2sql-dynamic -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret -e POSTGRES_USER=myuser -e POSTGRES_DB=mydatabase -p 5432:5432 -d postgres

5. The schema and data are stored in 
schema.sql
data.sql

6. Add configuration in applications.properties file
# needed for open ai access
spring.ai.openai.api-key=${OPEN_AI_KEY}
# this ensures that schema and data files are read and created while running the application
spring.sql.init.mode=always
# below 3 lines are database connection parameters
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydatabase
spring.datasource.username=myuser
spring.datasource.password=secret

7. Run the program once to make sure that schema and data are created in the database

8. The below 3 files are used to warp Exceptions, Request, Response and a Custom Exception Handler. 
AiException.java
AiRequest.java
AiResponse.java
CustomExceptionHandler.java

9. Add a controller file that accepts a message, 
wraps a the incoming query with the user prompt template stored in sql-prompt-template.st file,
which also contains has the DDL attached with it based on which AI must return SQL response  
and sends it to the ChatGPT engine to return the response. 

Check the below part in the SqlController.java controller file 
Check the two methods, sql & sql-dynamic method for details. 

In the sql method we read a static ddl that is stored in the classpath 
which we feed into the AI engine.

In the sql-dynamic method we build our own ddl based on database and table
metadata, then convert into into a json format which we feed into the AI engine.

10. Run the application in 2 diffent way based on static & dynamic metadata fetching
From static DDL statements: 
---------------------------
Run the application and excute a curl command to see the respone:
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/sql' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "text": "Find the account with maximum balance."
}'

This will result in a response containing the SQL query and its response like below:
{
    "sqlQuery": "select * from TBL_ACCOUNT where balance = (select max(balance) from TBL_ACCOUNT);",
    "results": [
        {
            "id": 6,
            "accountnumber": "ACC006",
            "user_id": 4,
            "balance": 3000.00,
            "opendate": "2024-07-09"
        }
    ]
}
Verify it with the database to check the correctness 

From dynamic DDL statements: 
---------------------------
Run the application and excute a curl command to see the respone:
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/sql-dynamic' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "text": "Find the account with maximum balance."
}'

This will result in a response containing the SQL query and its response like below:
{
    "sqlQuery": "select * from TBL_ACCOUNT where balance = (select max(balance) from TBL_ACCOUNT);",
    "results": [
        {
            "id": 6,
            "accountnumber": "ACC006",
            "user_id": 4,
            "balance": 3000.00,
            "opendate": "2024-07-09"
        }
    ]
}
Verify it with the database to check the correctness 

```

## Inject Custom Functions - (ai-inject-custom-function)
```xml 
1. Spring Initilizer
Go to spring initilizer page https://start.spring.io/ 
and add the following dependencies: 
Spring Web
OpenAI
DevTools 

2. Create a project 'ai-inject-custom-function' and download

3. The pom.xml will have the following dependencies: 
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-ai-starter-model-openai</artifactId>
</dependency>

<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-devtools</artifactId>
  <scope>runtime</scope>
  <optional>true</optional>
</dependency>


4. Add configuration in applications.properties file
# needed for open ai access
spring.ai.openai.api-key=${OPEN_AI_KEY}

5. Run the application once to make sure that it starts without errors by 
injecting your OPEN_AI_KEY 

6. Create 2 service classes and their associated util classes 
WeatherService.java 
RectangularAreaService.java
These 2 classes hold the business logic needed for the application

The following util classes are used for carrying the request and 
response objects to the service layers: 
Request.java
Response.java
WeatherRequest.java
WeatherResponse.java

7. Add the following Configuration files: 
CustomFunctions.java
WeatherTools.java

The purpose of these files are: 
Instead of specifying tools programmatically, you can define tools as Spring beans 
and let Spring AI resolve them dynamically at runtime using the 
ToolCallbackResolver interface (via the SpringBeanToolCallbackResolver implementation). 
This option gives you the possibility to use any Function, Supplier, Consumer, 
or BiFunction bean as a tool. 


8. The Controller has 3 different ways of calling a custom functions:
areaOfRectangle -> This is used to directly call the function along with prompt 
which is deprecated and not be used in future. 
getTemperature -> This is used to register a tool call back that can be used 
to create a ChatClient
getTemperatureWithTools -> This is used to directly register a tool amd use it 
within our application

All 3 methods are used in different ways to register a function and call it,
within the boundaries of AI models. 


9. Run the application - 3 differnt ways:
Way 1: 
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/area-rectangle?
message=%22What%20is%20the%20area%20of%20rectangle%20with%20height%2020%20and%20base%203%22' \
--data ''

Way 2: 
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/weather' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "question": "What'\''s the weather like in Abu Dhabi?"
}'


Way 3:
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/weather-tools' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "question": "What'\''s the weather like in Abu Dhabi?"
}'

```

## Chat Memory (a session managment alternative for AI models) - (ai-chat-memory)
```xml 
1. Spring Initilizer
Go to spring initilizer page https://start.spring.io/ 
and add the following dependencies: 
Spring Web
OpenAI
DevTools 
Spring Data JPA
Postgres


2. Create a project 'ai-chat-memory' and download

3. The pom.xml will have the following dependencies: 
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jpa</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-ai-starter-model-openai</artifactId>

  <optional>true</optional>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.postgresql</groupId>
  <artifactId>postgresql</artifactId>
  <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>

Note: An additional chat memory dependency needs to be added as below:
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-ai-starter-model-chat-memory-jdbc</artifactId>
</dependency>

4. Add configuration in applications.properties file
# needed for open ai access
spring.ai.openai.api-key=${OPEN_AI_KEY}
# Data source url 
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydatabase
# User name for DB
spring.datasource.username=myuser
# Password for DB
spring.datasource.password=secret
# Initilize the chat memory schema automatically 
spring.ai.chat.memory.repository.jdbc.initialize-schema=true

5. Run the application once to make sure that it starts without errors by 
injecting your OPEN_AI_KEY 

6. Create a configuration class which connects to the database 
using the jdbcTemplate and stores all chat conversations. 
Note: We used MessageWindowChatMemory which is an implementation
of ChatMemory which stores maximum no. of messages, before it deletes
the older messages. 
In our configuration we set the maximum message limit to 10 
using MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE=10

Refer the config class at 
ChatClientConfig.java

7. Two Controller classes have 2 different ways of implementations of chat memory:

InMemoryChatMemoryController.java -> Is an in memory store which stores max 10 messages
but the messages get reset when the application terminates. 

JdbcChatMemoryController.java -> Stores all chat converstation into a database table. 
We set the maximum storage limit to 10 messages using our custom conversation id 
set in the variable 'CONVERSTATION_ID'. In real-time application this could be replaced 
with user id or session id or any other id as per our application choice. 


9. Run the application in two different ways: In Memory and Database Table storage

Way 1: In Memory Conversation Storage 
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/in-memory-chat' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data 'My name is balaji, I am 50 years of age and I come from India'

curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/in-memory-chat' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data 'What is my name and where do I come from?'


Way 2: Database Table Storage 
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/chat' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data 'My name is balaji, I am 50 years of age and I come from India'

curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/chat' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data 'What is my name and where do I come from?'

Get chat history:
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/chat/history' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data 'Do you know what my name is?'

Delete all chat history:
curl --location --request DELETE 'http://localhost:8080/chat/history' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' 

```

## Mutiple AI Models - (ai-multi-model)
```xml
Why you might want to use multiple LLMs in your application:
-----------------------------------------------------------
Comparative Analysis: Different models may excel in various tasks. 
By using multiple LLMs, you can compare outputs and choose the best result.

Specialized Capabilities: Some models might be better at certain tasks, 
like code generation or creative writing.

Redundancy: Having multiple LLMs can provide fallback options 
if one service is unavailable or rate-limited.

Cost Optimization: Different providers have varying pricing models. 
You can route requests to the most cost-effective option based on the task.

1. Spring Initilizer
Go to spring initilizer page https://start.spring.io/ 
and add the following dependencies: 
Spring Web
OpenAI
Anthropic
DevTools 

2. Create a project 'ai-multi-model' and download

4. Add configuration in applications.properties file
# Disable the auto-configuration for ChatClient
# This is important for using multiple ChatClient 
# as default injected by spring must be disabled 
spring.ai.chat.client.enabled=false
# Inject OpenAI key through environment variable
spring.ai.openai.api-key=${OPENAI_API_KEY}
# Select the OpenAI model to use
spring.ai.openai.chat.model=gpt-4
# Inject Anthropic key through environment variable
spring.ai.anthropic.api-key=${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}
# Select the Anthropic model to use
spring.ai.anthropic.chat.model=claude-3-sonnet-20240229

5. Run the application once to make sure that it starts without errors by 
injecting your OPENAI_API_KEY & ANTHROPIC_API_KEY through env variables

6. Manually create bean definitions for each ChatClient 
Refer the config class at 
ChatClientConfiguration.java

Here two beans are injected as openAIChatClient and anthropicAIChatClient
(manually configuring our ChatClient)

7. Two Controller classes are created:

OpenAiChatController.java -> This is used for creating the ChatClient
using OpenAI  

AnthropicChatController.java -> This is used for creating the ChatClient
using Anthropic (Claude) 

8. Run the application to test the two Controllers: 

curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/claude'

curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/openai'

Each request will return an interesting fact about the respective company, 
demonstrating that we're successfully communicating with two different LLMs 
in the same application.

spring.ai.anthropic.api-key=${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}

5. Run the application once to make sure that it starts without errors by 
injecting your OPENAI_API_KEY & ANTHROPIC_API_KEY through env variables

6. Manually create bean definitions for each ChatClient. 
This will allow us to pick the chat client we want during runtime.
Refer the config class at 
MultiModelChatClientConfiguration.java

Here two beans are injected as openAIChatClient and anthropicAIChatClient
(manually configuring our ChatClient)

7. Controller classes:

7.1. OpenAiChatController.java
This is used for creating the ChatClient
using OpenAI and general OpenAI prompt option parameters are 
explained here.
Run this controller with the below curl command: 
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/openai-chatoptions'


7.2. AnthropicChatController.java
This is used for creating the ChatClient
using Anthropic (Claude) and general Anthropic prompt option parameters are 
explained here.
Run this controller with the below curl command:
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/claude-chatoptions'


7.3. Zero-Shot Prompting
Zero-shot prompting involves asking an AI to perform a task without providing any examples. 
This approach tests the model's ability to understand and execute instructions from scratch. 
Large language models are trained on vast corpora of text, allowing them to understand what 
tasks like "translation," "summarization," or "classification" entail 
without explicit demonstrations.
Zero-shot is ideal for straightforward tasks where the model likely has seen similar examples 
during training, and when you want to minimize prompt length. However, performance may vary 
depending on task complexity and how well the instructions are formulated.

Sample Controller: ZeroShotController.java
Run this controller with the below curl command:
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/openai-zeroshotprompting'


7.4. One-Shot & Few-Shot Prompting
Few-shot prompting provides the model with one or more examples to help guide its responses, 
particularly useful for tasks requiring specific output formats. 
By showing the model examples of desired input-output pairs, 
it can learn the pattern and apply it to new inputs without explicit parameter updates.

One-shot provides a single example, which is useful when examples are costly or 
when the pattern is relatively simple. 
Few-shot uses multiple examples (typically 3-5) to help the model better understand patterns in 
more complex tasks or to illustrate different variations of correct outputs.

Sample Controller: OneShotFewShotController.java
Run this controller with the below curl command:
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/openai-oneshotfewshotprompting'


7.5. System prompting
System prompting sets the overall context and purpose for the language model, 
defining the "big picture" of what the model should be doing. 
It establishes the behavioral framework, constraints, 
and high-level objectives for the model's responses, separate 
from the specific user queries.

System prompts act as a persistent "mission statement" throughout the conversation, 
allowing you to set global parameters like output format, tone, ethical boundaries, 
or role definitions. Unlike user prompts which focus on specific tasks, 
system prompts frame how all user prompts should be interpreted.

Sample Controller: SystemPromptController.java
Run this controller with the below curl commands:
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/openai-systemprompting1'
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/openai-systemprompting2'


7.6 Role prompting
Role prompting instructs the model to adopt a specific role or persona, 
which affects how it generates content. By assigning a particular identity, 
expertise, or perspective to the model, you can influence the style, tone, 
depth, and framing of its responses.

Role prompting leverages the model's ability to simulate different expertise domains 
and communication styles. Common roles include expert 
(e.g., "You are an experienced data scientist"), professional (e.g., "Act as a travel guide"), 
or stylistic character (e.g., "Explain like you're Shakespeare").

Sample Controller: RolePromptController.java
Run this controller with the below curl commands:
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/openai-roleprompting1'
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/openai-roleprompting2'


7.7 Contextual Prompting
Contextual prompting provides additional background information to the model 
by passing context parameters. This technique enriches the model's understanding 
of the specific situation, enabling more relevant and tailored responses 
without cluttering the main instruction.

By supplying contextual information, you help the model understand the specific domain, 
audience, constraints, or background facts relevant to the current query. 
This leads to more accurate, relevant, and appropriately framed responses.

Sample Controller: ContextPromptController.java
Run this controller with the below curl commands:
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/openai-contextprompting'


7.8 Step-back prompting
Step-back prompting breaks complex requests into simpler steps by first acquiring 
background knowledge. This technique encourages the model to first "step back" 
from the immediate question to consider the broader context, fundamental principles, 
or general knowledge relevant to the problem before addressing the specific query.

By decomposing complex problems into more manageable components and establishing 
foundational knowledge first, the model can provide more accurate responses to 
difficult questions.

Sample Controller: StepbackPromptController.java
Run this controller with the below curl commands:
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/openai-stepbackprompting'


7.9 Chain of Thought (CoT)
Chain of Thought prompting encourages the model to reason step-by-step through a problem, 
which improves accuracy for complex reasoning tasks. By explicitly asking the model to show 
its work or think through a problem in logical steps, you can dramatically improve performance 
on tasks requiring multi-step reasoning.

CoT works by encouraging the model to generate intermediate reasoning steps before 
producing a final answer, similar to how humans solve complex problems. This makes the model's 
thinking process explicit and helps it arrive at more accurate conclusions.

Sample Controller: ChainOfThoughtPromptController.java
Run this controller with the below curl commands:
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/openai-cotzeroshotprompting'
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/openai-cotsinglefewshotprompting'


7.10 Self-Consistency
Self-consistency involves running the model multiple times and aggregating results 
for more reliable answers. This technique addresses the variability in LLM outputs by 
sampling diverse reasoning paths for the same problem and selecting the most 
consistent answer through majority voting.

By generating multiple reasoning paths with different temperature or sampling settings, 
then aggregating the final answers, self-consistency improves accuracy on complex reasoning 
tasks. It's essentially an ensemble method for LLM outputs.

Sample Controller: SelfConsistencyPromptController.java
Run this controller with the below curl commands:
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/openai-selfconsistencyprompting'


7.11 Tree of Thoughts (ToT)
Tree of Thoughts (ToT) is an advanced reasoning framework that extends Chain of Thought 
by exploring multiple reasoning paths simultaneously. It treats problem-solving as a 
search process where the model generates different intermediate steps, 
evaluates their promise, and explores the most promising paths.

This technique is particularly powerful for complex problems with multiple possible 
approaches or when the solution requires exploring various alternatives 
before finding the optimal path.

Sample Controller: TreeOfThoughtPromptController.java
Run this controller with the below curl commands:
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/openai-treeofthoughtprompting'


7.12 Automatic Prompt Engineering
Automatic Prompt Engineering uses the AI to generate and evaluate alternative prompts. 
This meta-technique leverages the language model itself to create, refine, 
and benchmark different prompt variations to find optimal formulations for specific tasks.

By systematically generating and evaluating prompt variations, 
APE can find more effective prompts than manual engineering, 
especially for complex tasks. It's a way of using AI to improve its own performance.

Sample Controller: AutomaticPromptController.java
Run this controller with the below curl commands:
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/openai-automaticprompting'


7.13 Code prompting
Code prompting refers to specialized techniques for code-related tasks. 
These techniques leverage LLMs' ability to understand and generate programming languages, 
enabling them to write new code, explain existing code, debug issues, and translate between languages.

Effective code prompting typically involves clear specifications, appropriate context 
(libraries, frameworks, style guidelines), and sometimes examples of similar code. 
Temperature settings tend to be lower (0.1-0.3) for more deterministic outputs.

Sample Controller: CodePromptController.java 
Run this controller with the below curl commands:

# The below curl is used for code prompting
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/openai-codeprompting'

# The below curl is used for code prompting along with explaination
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/openai-explaincodeprompting'

# The below curl is used for code in one programming lanuage to another programming language 
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/openai-translatecodeprompting'
